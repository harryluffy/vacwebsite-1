        Physician's Release Form (only if required)
      </h5>
      <p>The attending physician must sign and mail or fax this form to the VAC.</p>
      <p>Our Physician's Release form is a note from the doctor assuring us that the service member/veteran is not prohibited from riding in a small plane. Click <%= link_to "here", passengers_travel_path %> to get the form.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5 class="fontColor1">
        Confirmation and scheduling
      </h5>
      <p>As soon as we have the required forms, we will call to confirm your mission, then schedule the flight. Once we schedule a plane and pilots, we'll put you in touch with your captain. After that, all scheduling and coordination will take place between you and your captain.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5 class="fontColor1">
        Rescheduling
      </h5>
      <p>The VAC is similar to the commercial airlines in that severe weather, icing and other unforeseen conditions can cause scheduling changes or even cancellations. Stay in contact with your captain, who will let you know if anything changes.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5 class="fontColor1">
        What to expect
      </h5>
      <h6>Captains and copilots</h6>
      <p>The captains who volunteer with the VAC take their missions and their duty to veterans very seriously. During flights, they typically are not available for social interactions, demonstrations, passenger assistance and so forth. Instead, expect them to concentrate on providing a professional, comfortable and safe flight.</p>
      <p>Your flight captain is the final authority on all aspects of the flight.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5 class="fontColor1">
        What's included
      </h5>
      <p>VAC volunteers provide air transport between airports. Passengers are responsible for travel between their homes or medical facilities and the airport. Passengers are welcome to bring luggage packed in soft-side suitcases or duffel bags. Total luggage limit per flight is 50 pounds, and prior permission is required for items of unusual size or shape.</p>
      <h6>Mobility Requirements and medical needs</h6>
      <p>In order to board and ride safely, passengers must be ambulatory, able to sit upright for up to three hours at a time, and otherwise physically capable of making the trip. We may require a physician's release for the recovering veteran to travel in small airplanes.</p>
      <p>Your pilot will be focused on providing a safe and comfortable flight. Because of this, in-flight medications must be self-administered, and any passenger who anticipates needing medical assistance of any kind should provide for a medical attendant to ride along on the flight.</p>
      <h6>Rescheduling</h6>
      <p>The VAC is similar to the commercial airlines in that severe weather, icing and other unforeseen conditions can cause scheduling changes or even cancellations. Stay in contact with your captain, who will let you know if anything changes.</p>

        Travel Request Form
      </h5>
      <p>The veteran or one passenger must fill out the online Travel Request.</p>
      <p>This form lets us know when and where a trip may be taking place. It's a good idea to fill out a Travel Request form as soon as you're sure you'll need transport. The more notice we have, the more likely it is that we will be able to fulfill your mission. Click <%= link_to "here", passengers_travel_path %> to get the form.</p>

      <h6>Families and friends as passengers <br> Service Member/Veteran status</h6>
      <p>Passengers are transported to and from the medical facility for the benefit of the service member/veteran, not the passengers. Passenger eligibility requires the service member/veteran to be undergoing continuing medical care, either hospitalized or as an outpatient.</p>
      <h6>Relationship to the service member/veteran</h6>
      <p>Passengers must be family or a very close personal friend of the veteran.</p>
